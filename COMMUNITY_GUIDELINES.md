## Purpose 

A primary goal of Chamaconekt Community is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse 
backgrounds possible.As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all regardless of gender,
sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequence of unacceptable 
behaviour.

We invite all those who participate in Chamaconekt Community to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## Open-Source Citizenship

A supplemental goal of these community guidelines is to increase open-source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognise the 
relationship between our actions and our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist.Positive action is essential to counteract the inequalities and abuses of power that
exist in society.

If you see someone making an extra effort to ensure our community welcomes all participants and encourages them to contribute, we want to
know!

## Reporting

If you are harassed by a member of the Chamaconekt Community, notice that someone else is being harased, or have any other concerns , 
please contact the community leaders at community@chamaconekt.org , and /or contact the administrators of the specific community
(e.g , the Facebook group moderators ).If the person who is harrasing you is a community leader or administrator, they will recuse
themselves from handling your incident.We will respond as promptly as we can.


These community guidelines apply to Chamaconekt Community spaces, but if you are being harrased by a member of the Chamaconekt
Community outside our spaces, we still want to know about it.We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by Chamaconekt Community
members, especially those from Chamaconekt Kenya, seriously.This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at
any point in time.The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from the Chamaconekt Community based on their past behaviour, 
including behaviour outside Chamaconekt Community spaces and behaviour towards people who are not in the Chamaconekt Community.

In order to protect employees and the response team from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have
been made in bad faith (e.g, a community member who has recently been reported for abuse or harassment says that he/she is actually the 
victim of harassment in the situation, with no evidence to back up his/her claim). Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may 
be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.At our discretion, we may publicly name a person
about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase
the safety of Chamaconekt Community members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.


## Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harrasing behaviour, our response team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to including removing that 
participant from all Chamaconekt Community spaces.
